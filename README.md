Explosional is a 3D split-screen game of one to four players with vehicles, weapons and explosions. And lava because why not.

Each player controls a vehicle with weapons.

In Competitive and Tough game modes, the objective is to destroy the other players using weapons or ramming. In Peaceful mode, there is no objective and no vehicle damage.

Explosional was developed with creative control from a 10yo gamer - so this game should appeal more to children than adults. Games typically last 5-10 minutes.

This is a beta release where many of the less-polished features have been disabled such as some vehicles (rally car, tank, truck), several of the weapons (air burst, nuke), AI (air strikes), and some effects (vehicle damage falling parts). We plan on fixing these features for future releases.
