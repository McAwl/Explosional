Explosional is a 3D split-screen game of one to four players with vehicles, weapons and explosions. 

Each player controls a vehicle with weapons.

In Competitive and Tough game modes, the objective is to destroy the other players using weapons or ramming. 
In Peaceful mode, there is no objective and no vehicle damage.

Explosional was designed with full(ish) creative control from a 10yo gamer - so this game should appeal more to children than adults. 

This is a beta release where many features have been disabled such as vehicles, weapons, AI, effects.
